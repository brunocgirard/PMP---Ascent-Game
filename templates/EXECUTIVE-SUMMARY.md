## What Enhanced MVE Adds Back

The 6 things Basic MVE was missing:

### 1. **Scenarios FIRST** ⚡
```
OLD (Basic):  Theory → Framework → Scenario → Test
NEW (Enhanced): Quick Scenario → Debrief → Framework → Apply
```
**Why**: Practice before learning = better engagement + retention

### 2. **Deep Gamification** 🎮
```
Progress Dashboard showing:
- XP earned
- Day streak 🔥
- Level progress
- Domain completion %
- Task-specific rewards
```
**Why**: Your research shows 226% completion increase

### 3. **Personal Connection** 🏢
```
Structured reflection exercise:
- Think of conflict in YOUR job
- Identify source & stage
- What would you do differently as PMP?
- Save to personal case library
```
**Why**: Adult learners retain 2-3x more with personal connection

### 4. **Spaced Repetition Scheduler** 🔄
```
Built-in review schedule:
📅 Tomorrow: Quick review (2 min)
📅 3 Days: Flashcard review (3 min)
📅 1 Week: Quiz retake (5 min)
📅 2 Weeks: Teach someone (10 min)

With calendar integration & reminders
```
**Why**: Doubles long-term retention (90% vs 50%)

### 5. **Multiple Practice Opportunities** 💪
```
OLD (Basic): 1 scenario
NEW (Enhanced):
  - Scenario 1 (before theory)
  - Scenario 2 (apply framework)
  - Personal reflection (YOUR job)
  - Quiz questions
```
**Why**: More practice = higher exam performance

### 6. **Memory Techniques** 🧠
```
Not just acronym, but:
- Visual story (Mountain Conflict)
- Spatial memory technique
- Printable reference cards
- Mnemonic devices
```
**Why**: Better recall under exam pressure
