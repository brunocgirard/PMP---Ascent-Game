    "scenarioStory": "Midway through your high-altitude climbing expedition, three issues emerge: (1) Your lead climber reports persistent shortness of breath due to altitude—not a blocker yet, but could become critical if ignored; (2) A supply shipment from base camp has been delayed by 5 days, meaning you might run low on oxygen canisters in 3 days; (3) Two team members have developed friction over camp duties, reducing team morale slightly but not affecting current climbing progress.",

      "A": "The altitude sickness concern—monitor the climber closely and adjust ascent schedule",
