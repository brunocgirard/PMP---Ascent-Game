Your budget cap is $350K and you need delivery in 3 months. During negotiations, the vendor mentions they could reduce cost if you extend the timeline to 5 months. As the PM, you realize you have flexibility on timeline but not on cost. Your sponsor wants the project done fast, but not at any price.",
