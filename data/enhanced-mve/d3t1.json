Your team has completed 60% of the development when your legal department informs you that new federal regulatory requirements (Section XYZ-401) must be implemented in all banking software by the end of Q3. Your sponsor says: 'This regulation is expensive to implement, and we're already over budget. Can we just skip it or implement it later after launch?' Your project timeline is tight, and the team is already stressed.",
