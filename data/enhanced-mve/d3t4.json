    "scenarioStory": "Your organization, a long-established manufacturing company, is undergoing strategic transformation. Leadership has decided to shift from making physical products to becoming a software-first, data-driven company. This is a MASSIVE organizational change. You're managing a critical project as part of this transformation: migrating customer data to a new cloud platform and building AI-driven analytics. However, you're noticing: (1) Middle management is resistant—they built their careers in manufacturing, (2) Some long-time employees are skeptical ('This will never work'), (3) The organizational culture is traditional, risk-averse, change-adverse, (4) Your project is critical to this transformation, but the organization culture isn't ready. Your sponsor says: 'Just deliver the project. They'll adapt.' You're concerned the organization won't embrace the change, and even if you deliver perfect deliverables, the transformation will fail if people resist.",
