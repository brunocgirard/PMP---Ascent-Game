Before you leave the summit, you need to: (1) Gather final data and measurements for your research mission; (2) Ensure all team members are accounted for and have enough resources for descent; (3) Schedule equipment hand-off with the relief expedition arriving in 2 days; (4) Document all lessons learned while fresh; (5) Notify all stakeholders (sponsors, media, support teams) of your success.",
