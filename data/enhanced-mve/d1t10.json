    "scenarioStory": "You're managing a cross-functional project with team members from Engineering, Marketing, and Sales. In the kickoff meeting, you ask everyone what 'on-time delivery' means. Engineering says: 'Code is stable and tested.' Marketing says: 'Ready to announce to customers.' Sales says: 'In customers' hands generating revenue.' Three different interpretations of the same term. The project is already 2 weeks in and the team is confused about timelines.",
