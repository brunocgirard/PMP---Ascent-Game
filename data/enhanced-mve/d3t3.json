    "scenarioStory": "You're 3 months into a 12-month e-commerce platform development project. Your team is executing well, schedule is solid, budget is tracking. Then one Monday morning, you wake up to news: a new federal regulation just passed requiring enhanced payment security standards (PCI-DSS 4.0) for all online retailers—effective in 6 months. This wasn't on your radar. Your current architecture uses PCI-DSS 3.2. Upgrading to 4.0 requires significant redesign work. Your sponsor asks: 'Can we ignore this? It won't affect us for 6 months, right?' Your team lead says: 'Maybe they'll change the deadline.' Your product owner wants to keep shipping features on schedule. Nobody's happy about the compliance disruption.",
