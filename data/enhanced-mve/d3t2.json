The project is 80% complete, deliverables are being produced, and the team is on schedule. However, when you review the benefits management plan, you notice: (1) No one has clearly defined what business benefits this project is supposed to deliver, (2) There's no measurement system to track whether benefits are being realized, (3) The sponsor hasn't reviewed actual value in 3 months. Your executive steering committee meeting is next week. You suspect the project is technically on track but strategically drifting—no one can articulate the business case anymore.",
