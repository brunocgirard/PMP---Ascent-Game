Deploying when users are unprepared risks project failure, productivity loss, and business disruption. Recommending delay based on objective readiness data demonstrates professional responsibility. While uncomfortable, protecting the organization from preventable failure is core PM accountability, even when it means bad news."

PMBOK emphasizes that organizational change should occur before and during implementation, not primarily after. Deploying to unprepared users creates productivity loss, frustration, and potential business impacts that intensive support may not fully mitigate. Prevention is better than remediation."

Separating technical infrastructure migration from business process changes allows focusing change management efforts. However, verify this is technically viable and doesn't create confusion from partial migration. Also ensure business stakeholders understand this extends overall project duration and requires sustained engagement."
